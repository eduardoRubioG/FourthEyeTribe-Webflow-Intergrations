Fourth Eye Tribe - Webflow Project
=============
This is a repo where I am housing the open source code used for the site I built for a client, Fourth Eye Tribe. This includes both package files I want to import at runtime on the client side as well as scripts I want to maintain. GitHub pages is active with this repo so that I can use GitHub as a server, of sorts. 

Threex.Terrain
=============
I am using Threex.Terrain library to produce the landing page terrain animation. Threex.terrain is a [three.js games extension](http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/) which provides a procedural terrain generated from a simplex noise, the [Perlin noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise). This was forked from [this repo](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.terrain)

This includes a slightly modified version of the ThreeJS library. I am also using the orbit controls library to handle the movement around the 3D scene.
